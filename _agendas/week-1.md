### Wednesday, Lab

- Introductions
- Discuss Git, GitHub Pages and navigating the terminal: [GitHub lecture](/lectures/lab/github)

### Homework

1. Read [The seven rules of a great git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)
1. Customize the index of your GitHub page. Use as much (or little) HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  as you feel comfortable with. Practice changing the file, committing it
  with a message, and pushing the changes to GitHub. Everyone should come to class
  on Week 2 with several additional commits logged. Make sure that your commit messages
  are short, descriptive and represent the changes you make, just like the seven rules
  recommends. You'll be using GitHub throughout the semester to post work online and
  save your coding progress, so it's important to feel comfortable with this process.
1. Read and/or review the following pages from w3schools. There will be a timed quiz next week that tests your knowledge of the concepts outlined in these pages.
  - [Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
  - [Text editors](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp)
  - [Basic examples](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp)
  - [HTML Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp)

  - [Headings](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp)
  - [Paragraphs](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp)
  - [Text formatting](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp)

- Working in small groups (of 2 or 3), present your ideas to each other. Describe what you&rsquo;re looking at, consider what the story is, analyze if the current assets are helping communicate the story. Consider which directions have the most potential, and what might make each one more interesting.
- Watch last 30 minutes of [Lo and Behold](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80097363?source=35)

### Homework
- Decide on the direction of your project and have a selection of your 10 pieces. If you're using photos – remember that in webdesign, you want a file size that's the smallest possible. Aim to have images <1mb where you can, and always export for web in photoshop. Jpgs, pngs, svgs, gifs all OK. Avoid large scale images such as tiffs and do not use pdfs.
- Have a clickable prototype of your project for Tuesday's class online
- Pick a discussion leader
- Read [Can the Internet Be Archived?](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb) and write a [discussion question](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15al68TvkBSFcG9sH8bvU5jqmKfVI5pYDwzq0Esqr-_U/edit?usp=sharing).
