### Tuesday, Studio

- Phoebe presents on [Too Much World: Is the Internet Dead? – Hito Steyerl](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/49/60004/too-much-world-is-the-internet-dead/) and we discuss & watch examples of Hito Steyrl's work
- Working in medium sized groups (4 people), present your project progress to each other. I&rsquo;ll go around and meet with everyone one on one.
- Time permitting: [Watch The Internet with a Human Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWFo1VaQNmU&t=2383s)

### Homework
- Based on your feedback, decide on one concept for your project. Design a draft of the project for Friday. (Enough to create a clickable prototype in class)
- Reading: [The Woman Who Gave Macintosh a Smile / Susan Kare](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-woman-who-gave-the-macintosh-a-smile)
- Simran is the discussion leader

### Wednesday, Lab

- Discuss challenges from last week's exercise.
- [Creating Our Own Mad Lib API](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Creating-Our-Own-Mad-Lib-API--AbbYv3tpp5A8byRlGlNY0B2gAg-vjBvnX1M7UcDEAcFOkG1b)
- One on one reviews.

### Homework

- Finish creating your Mad Lib websites. Your websites should be able to pull data from each student's API. This can be done in a random
way, or based on user input. It will likely be easiest to use a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to insert the data from the API
into your web page. We'll discuss several techniques in class for how to achieve this.
- Make sure to handle errors in the `$.get` function by using the `fail` callback in the example provided in the Paper doc in case any of the endpoints
return bad data.

### Friday, Studio

- Simran presents on Susan Kare
- Review [userflows and wireframes](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/User-Flows-and-Wireframes--AXKIiGCUq52XdCS8VrZujFU7AQ-SiwIpBpGAlNBJuYgQbugm)
- Look at an example of how a product designer might discuss his/her work and present their process
- Take a step back and map out the userflow of your project. Then, working in Sketch, decide on something to compare (for example, navigation for your project, or a general layout). Create two clickable prototypes testing out this feature. Invite a partner(s) to test out your comparison. Record your findings and your exploration on a single page website discussing what you tested, why, and how it might impact your final design.
- Work on project


### Homework
- Find two job descriptions for jobs you might consider. Find one that you think is well written, and one that is poorly written.
- Reading: [A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/)
- Gavin is the discussion leader
- Continue developing your project. Begin programming.
