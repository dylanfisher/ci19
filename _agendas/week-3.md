- Present your projects to a partner and work on homework. I&rsquo;ll go around to meet about your project.

### Homework

- Based on today&rsquo;s feedback, pick one direction for your assignment and consolidate all our maxims into an are.na channel.
- Begin considering different ways someone could view the maxims. Create a userlow and wireframe for your project. You&rsquo;re encouraged to experiment and explore several ideas, but pick one that&rsquo;s general enough that can be elaborated upon in the design phase. Use Sketch to do both of these and have them in one document on separate pages by next class.
- Read [The Web&rsquo;s Grain by Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/) and write a [discussion question](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IXcT8DUDbmWsiJnMsmX5MK7J1VgufhrgikVV3Kq1tJI/edit?usp=sharing). Pick a discussion leader!
