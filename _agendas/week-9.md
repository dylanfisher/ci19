### Tuesday, Studio

- Welcome back from spring break!
- Activity: Spend 15 to 30 minutes creating a clickable prototype of your project (so far) in Sketch. Once you have a functional prototype, generate the cloud share URL and share it with 1 to 2 partners. Without sharing any information or details about your project, see how your partner(s) interact with your design. Collect some notes regarding their behavior. For example: What are the first things they click on? Do they move through your design in the way that you would want? Are there any roadblocks? Once you&rsquo;ve discussed these items, step in and talk about your intention with the project. Discuss how the "invisible" design decisons (the copywriting, the way things are arranged) as well as formal design elements are working together. What stands out? Where can you expand upon the design?
- While you&rsquo;re working on this, I&rsquo;ll meet with everyone to see their project progress.
- Rest of class is a work day

### Homework
- Bring your phone charger to class (the cable that connects your phone to your computer). We&rsquo;ll be using Sketch Mirror in class.
- Begin programming your project
- Reading: [Luna Maurer on Being a Designer](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/luna-maurer-on-being-a-designer/), choose a discussion leader who will discuss the reading as well as studio [Moniker](https://www.studiomoniker.com/)
