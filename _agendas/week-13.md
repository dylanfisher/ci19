### Wednesday, Lab

- Workshop time and individual meetings.
- If you are using an API for your final project you should now be able to successfully pull information
  from the API and manipulate your website with it in JavaScript. If you are unable to do this let's figure it
  out together.
- if you are not using an API, let's discuss how you will be using JavaScript to create a dynamic website that
  generates content or otherwise responds to external factors.

### Homework

- Continue programming Live Data projects. Identify problem areas that you may need help solving and reach out for help.
- Consider setting up additional time to meet with our [Tutor Specialists](/info/#tutor-schedule).
