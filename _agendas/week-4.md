### Wednesday, Lab

- Exercise: [Coding from Life](/lectures/lab/coding-from-life)

### Homework

If you did not finish the drawings in class, or you'd like to spend more time working on them, take a photo of the still life and complete it at home. If you weren't in class this week you'll need to create a still life of your own.

Create an archive of all the drawings completed in class, both your own drawings and the two drawings from each other student.
You can find each project from the [students](/students) page, in their github repos.

Store this archive in the your github projects directory, e.g. at this path `projects/coding-from-life-archive`. Your archives should consist
of a `index.html` and `main.css`, just like the Coding from Life sketches in the starter kit.

Your archives should link to each drawing directly. For example, if I had created a drawing, you would link to `http://fisherdm.github.io/projects/coding-from-life/sketch-1/index.html`.

You should consider how you choose to organize the drawings. Is it alphabetically, chronologically, by color, random, or something else?

You should consider how you display the drawings. Is it with an image of the sketch, or a more abstract representation of the sketch, or just text?

Once your archive is complete and correctly linked to each student's sketch, add a new link to your github pages home page page linking to the
archive, and to your two sketches.
