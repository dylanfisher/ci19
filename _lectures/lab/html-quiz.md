### Instructions

1. Create a new directory in your github repo named `html-quiz`.
1. Inside this directory create a file named `index.html`. Make sure this is a valid HTML5 document.
1. Complete the quiz by adding your answers to the index.html file.
1. At the end of the quiz upload your new file to GitHub. Refer to the [Resources page](/resources) if you need help with the commands to navigate to your directory in the terminal and push to github.

You have 30 minutes to complete the quiz. You may use the internet to help answer the questions if necessary, but don't share or copy code between students.
