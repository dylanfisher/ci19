### Overview

For your midterm, we’re going to make a personal archive. The archive should contain 50–100 different pieces in it. The content of the archive is entirely up to you and should reflect one of your interests or ruminations. The content can be found, your own, or a combination of both. The archive must invite the user to interact and discover it. What are ways that we can use a collection of items to communicate a larger narrative?


1. Think about how the archive is organized (or disorganized).
2. The project must include a visual component: photos, illustrations, etc. as well as a typographic component
3. Consider how the user interacts with your archive, and how the archive is experienced. Is it immediately accessible in its entirety, or is the user required to discover it? Do you see it one by one? Are there multiple ways of viewing the content?
4. The project is required to have at least two views: a full archive as well as a detail view that has different information.
5. Project must have a title and favicon.

### Deadlines

Due March 15th. Check agenda for increments.
