### Overview
We’ve explored different ways that you can use the web for personal publishing, art, storage and reading. Now, let’s consider another difference between print and digital design – it’s live! Not only is it easy to change and update digital work, you also have access to an entire community of data and people. How can you use information that’s stored in a public API to continue exploring your work?

Choose a public API from [this list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). Consider how you can use the contents of an API in a meaningful way. Can you add interest to the API by using it outside of the way it was intended? You&rsquo;ll create a website that's alive and evolving. With this in mind, how will you design an interface that will change and interact with a constant stream of information that isn&rsquo;t always the same?

Here are a couple basic examples of websites that use APIs (not in a very creative way) to help communicate what an API is. On Friday we&rsquo;ll explore more websites that design for changing content:
[Is it Raining In](https://isitraining.in/), [Is the L Train Running](https://isthelrunning.com/)
